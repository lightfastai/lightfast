## Blog best practices for AI-era search

- Start from a single, answerable question or decision the reader has and phrase it the way they’d ask an AI assistant.
- Define the target persona, funnel stage, and primary business outcome before outlining; cut sections that don’t serve that outcome.
- Open with a 2–3 sentence summary that directly answers the core question and states the main outcome so it can stand alone as a quotable snippet.
- Introduce clear one-sentence definitions for key concepts near the top of the post so answer engines can cite them early.
- Use descriptive H2/H3 headings that mirror real prompts (e.g. “How does X compare to Y?”, “When should you use X?”).
- Keep sections as self-contained “chunks” (1–3 short paragraphs plus bullets) so they can be safely quoted in isolation.
- Prefer structured formats—bulleted lists, numbered steps, and comparison tables—especially for how-to content and product evaluations.
- Write in plain, precise language; define jargon in-line and avoid filler, hedging, and marketing clichés.
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences) and sentences tight; remove any line that doesn’t add new information or clarity.
- Make claims concrete and verifiable; when you use numbers or strong assertions, back them with a linkable primary source.
- State explicitly what the product or idea is and is not; avoid implying unshipped functionality or guarantees you can’t support.
- Attribute each post to a real author with role and relevant experience; include that context in the byline or introduction.
- Use consistent product names, taglines, and key phrases across posts so AI systems see a stable, authoritative narrative.
- Add 2–4 internal links to canonical docs, overviews, or case studies that deepen the topic and give answer engines reliable follow-up sources.
- End with a short “Key takeaways” or “Summary” list that restates the 3–5 most important points in simple, declarative sentences.
