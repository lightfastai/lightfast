- Identity: ./identity.md

Ingestion
- Sync Design: ./ingestion/sync-design.md
- Observations Heuristics: ./ingestion/observations-heuristics.md

Retrieval
- Search Design: ./retrieval/search-design.md
- Router Diagram: ./retrieval/router-diagram.md

Storage
- Architecture: ./storage/architecture.md
- Diagrams: ./storage/diagrams.md
- Implementation Guide: ./storage/implementation-guide.md

Memory
- Overview: ./memory/README.md
- Spec: ./memory/spec.md
- Graph: ./memory/graph.md
- Org vs Workspace: ./memory/org-workspace-memory.md

Operations
