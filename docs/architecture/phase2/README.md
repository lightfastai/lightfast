# Phase 2 — Linear + Notion

Expand beyond GitHub + Docs by adding Linear and Notion, turning on the memory layer (observations, summaries, profiles, graph) for selected stores.

---

## Goals

- Integrate Linear (issues, projects, teams) and Notion (databases/pages) as sources.
- Keep DX: configure via `lightfast.yml` store entries; no IDs exposed.
- Enable memory incrementally per store to power cross-tool retrieval and reasoning.

## Navigation

- Config: ./config.md
- Scenarios: ./scenarios.md
- Implementation Plan: ./implementation-plan.md
- Open Questions: ./open-questions.md
