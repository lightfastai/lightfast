# Claude Code Development Workflow

This document outlines the complete development workflow for Claude Code when working with this chat application project.

## Overview

The development workflow integrates:
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Issue tracking and PR management
- **Git Worktrees**: Isolated feature development with `jeevanpillay/<feature_name>` branches
- **Local Development**: Build validation and linting before commits
- **Vercel CLI**: Deployment monitoring and troubleshooting

## End-to-End Feature Development Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation & Planning

#### Using Issue Templates
The repository provides three Claude Code-optimized issue templates:

1. **Feature Request** - For new features and enhancements
   ```bash
   # When creating a feature request:
   # 1. Use clear "What needs to be done?" language
   # 2. Include file references like @src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx
   # 3. Define browser-testable success criteria
   # 4. Add technical hints for faster implementation
   ```

2. **Bug Report** - For browser-specific issues
   ```bash
   # When reporting bugs:
   # 1. Describe what's broken in the browser
   # 2. Reference specific components with @-mentions
   # 3. Include console errors if any
   # 4. List browsers where issue was verified
   ```

3. **Quick Task** - For simple, straightforward tasks
   ```bash
   # For quick tasks:
   # 1. Brief task description
   # 2. File location (can use @src/path/to/file.tsx)
   # 3. How to test in browser
   ```

#### File References in Issues
Use @ symbol to reference files directly:
- `@src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx` - Specific component files
- `@convex/messages.ts` - Backend files
- `@package.json` - Configuration files
- `@CLAUDE.md` - Documentation

This helps Claude Code navigate directly to relevant files when picking up an issue.

#### Creating Issues via GitHub CLI
```bash
# List available templates and add to project
gh issue create --repo lightfastai/chat --project 2

# Create with specific template and add to project
gh issue create --template feature_request.md --project 2

# Create issue with automatic project assignment
gh issue create --repo lightfastai/chat \
  --title "feat: <feature_description>" \
  --body "Description of the feature" \
  --project 2

# Or use GitHub web UI which will show template chooser
# Note: Web UI won't automatically add to project
```

**Task Planning & PR Description Management**:
- Use GitHub PR descriptions as the primary task planner and tracker
- Create todo lists for complex features using TodoWrite tool
- Continuously reference and update PR descriptions throughout development
- Link all tasks back to issue acceptance criteria
- Update PR descriptions with progress, blockers, and completion status

### 2. Git Worktree Setup

#### Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the automated setup script for complete worktree initialization
./scripts/setup-worktree.sh <feature_name>

# This script automatically:
# - Ensures main branch is up-to-date
# - Creates worktree at worktrees/<feature_name>
# - Creates branch jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
# - Installs dependencies with pnpm install
# - Copies .env.local configuration
# - Syncs environment variables to Convex
# - Provides next steps guidance

# Example:
./scripts/setup-worktree.sh add-dark-mode
```

#### Manual Setup (Advanced)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Start with up-to-date main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create worktree for feature development (use subdirectory due to Claude Code path restrictions)
mkdir -p worktrees
git worktree add worktrees/<feature_name> -b jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Change to worktree directory
cd worktrees/<feature_name>

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp ../../.env.local .env.local

# Sync environment variables to Convex
pnpm env:sync

# Note: Claude Code can only access child directories of the working directory
# Worktree will be created at: worktrees/<feature_name>/
# New branch is based on current main, so main must be up-to-date
```

### 3. Development Cycle
```bash
# Navigate to your worktree (if not already there)
cd worktrees/<feature_name>

# Start development servers (choose one option):
# Option 1: Concurrent development (recommended)
pnpm dev:all

# Option 2: Separate terminals
# Terminal 1: pnpm dev              # Next.js development server
# Terminal 2: pnpm convex:dev       # Convex backend development server

# Make code changes
# ... implement feature ...

# Local validation - MUST pass before commit
# Note: For build without environment variables, use:
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true pnpm build
# Or alternatively, pull environment variables:
# vc env pull

pnpm lint
pnpm format

# Fix any issues found by build/lint
# Repeat until all checks pass
```

### 4. Commit & Push
```bash
# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement <feature_name>

<detailed description>

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
```

### 5. PR Creation & GitHub Project Integration
```bash
# Create PR and automatically add to lightfast-chat project
gh pr create --repo lightfastai/chat --project 2

# Or create PR with specific details
gh pr create --title "feat: <feature_name>" \
  --body "Closes #<issue_number>" \
  --project 2

# Link to original issue
# Include test plan and deployment notes
```

**PR Description as Task Planner**:
- Use PR description as the central task planning and tracking document
- Include todo lists with checkboxes for task progress visualization
- Reference todo list progress and completion status
- Include detailed test plan with acceptance criteria verification
- Document any blockers or issues encountered during development
- Add deployment notes and environment considerations
- Link to related issues and maintain traceability
- Update PR description continuously as development progresses

**GitHub Project Management**:
The repository uses the **lightfast-chat** project (ID: 2) for tracking all development work:
- All new issues and PRs should be automatically added to the project
- Issues start in "Todo" status
- PRs typically move to "In Progress" when created
- Use `--project 2` flag when creating issues/PRs via GitHub CLI

### 6. Deployment Monitoring
```bash
# Check deployment status (requires --yes flag)
vercel ls --yes

# Monitor deployment via GitHub PR status checks
gh pr view <pr_number> --json statusCheckRollup

# Alternative: Monitor deployment logs (if deployment ID known)
vercel logs --follow <deployment_id>

# Get deployment details via GitHub PR
gh pr view <pr_number>

# Note: Vercel CLI requires confirmation for many commands
# GitHub CLI integration provides better PR/deployment monitoring
```

### 7. PR Merge & Cleanup
```bash
# Check PR merge readiness
gh pr view <pr_number> --json state,mergeable,statusCheckRollup

# Merge PR (squash commit with branch deletion)
gh pr merge <pr_number> --squash --delete-branch

# If merge fails due to worktree checkout, clean up first:
# 1. Remove worktree (must be done before branch deletion)
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>

# 2. Delete local branch (if not auto-deleted)
git branch -d jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# 3. Update main branch with merged changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify the merge was successful
git log --oneline -5  # Check recent commits include your feature

# Close related issue if not auto-closed
gh issue close <issue_number> --comment "✅ Completed in PR #<pr_number>"
```

### 8. Post-Merge Cleanup Workflow
```bash
# Complete cleanup checklist:
# 1. ✅ PR merged and remote branch deleted
# 2. ✅ Local worktree removed
# 3. ✅ Local branch cleaned up
# 4. ✅ Main branch updated with git pull origin main
# 5. ✅ Merged changes verified in local main
# 6. ✅ Related issues closed
# 7. ✅ Verify feature is live in production

# CRITICAL: Always sync main branch after merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git status  # Ensure clean working tree with latest changes

# If deployment fails, iterate:
# 1. Check vercel logs for errors
# 2. Fix issues locally
# 3. Run pnpm build + pnpm lint
# 4. Commit and push
# 5. Monitor new deployment
```

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's a real example of the full workflow using issue templates:

### Example: Adding Dark Mode Feature

1. **Create Issue with Template**
   ```bash
   # Via GitHub UI: Click "New Issue" → Select "Feature Request"
   # Fill out template:
   ```
   ```markdown
   ## What needs to be done?
   Add a dark mode toggle to the application that persists user preference

   ## Success looks like
   - [ ] Toggle button in header next to user menu
   - [ ] Theme persists across page refreshes
   - [ ] Smooth transition between themes
   - [ ] All components properly styled for dark mode

   ## Technical hints
   - Start with: @src/app/layout.tsx for theme provider
   - Related to: @src/components/ui components need dark variants
   - Uses: next-themes library (already in @package.json)

   ## Browser testing required
   - [ ] Works on Chrome/Edge/Safari
   - [ ] No console errors
   - [ ] Theme toggle animates smoothly
   ```

2. **Claude Code picks up the issue**
   - Sees @-mentions and navigates directly to layout.tsx
   - Checks package.json to confirm next-themes is available
   - Reviews UI components for theming approach

3. **Create worktree and implement**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-worktree.sh jeevanpillay/add-dark-mode
   cd worktrees/add-dark-mode
   pnpm dev:all
   # Implementation happens here...
   ```

4. **Create PR with comprehensive description**
   - Links to issue
   - Updates task list as work progresses
   - Documents any challenges or decisions

This workflow ensures Claude Code has all context needed to implement features efficiently.

## Project Specifics

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15 Canary** with App Router + Partial Prerendering (PPR)
- **Convex** for real-time database & API
- **Biome** for linting/formatting (not ESLint/Prettier)
- **shadcn/ui** components (New York style)
- **Tailwind CSS v4.x**
- **AI SDK** with Claude Sonnet 4 + OpenAI
- **TypeScript** strict mode
- **pnpm** package manager (v10.11.0)

### Code Style (Biome Configuration)
- 2-space indentation, 80-character line width
- Double quotes for JSX and strings
- Arrow parentheses always required
- Non-null assertions allowed in TypeScript
- Import organization enabled
- **IMPORTANT**: Uses Biome, not ESLint/Prettier

### Component Structure
```
src/components/
├── ui/           # shadcn/ui components
├── chat/         # Chat-specific components
└── auth/         # Authentication components
```
- Use TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation consistently
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for component composition

### Project-Specific Features
- **Resumable streams**: Custom implementation for surviving disconnections
- **Feedback system**: v0.dev-inspired thumbs up/down with detailed feedback
- **AI model management**: Multi-provider support with token tracking
- **Thread-based chat**: Complex schema with resumable streaming chunks

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Use pnpm (not npm/yarn) - v10.11.0
pnpm install

# Concurrent development (runs both Next.js and Convex)
pnpm dev:all

# Individual development servers
pnpm dev              # Next.js development server

# Get logs for specific deployment
vercel logs <deployment_id>

# Inspect deployment details
vercel inspect <deployment_url>

# Note: Many vercel commands require --yes flag for confirmation
# GitHub CLI provides better integration for monitoring deployments
```

## Branch Naming Convention

All feature branches must follow the pattern:
```
jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
```

Examples:
- `jeevanpillay/add-dark-mode`
- `jeevanpillay/fix-chat-threading`
- `jeevanpillay/improve-ai-responses`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
```bash
# Environment variable errors during build
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true pnpm build

# Or pull environment variables from Vercel
vc env pull

# Common fixes:
# - TypeScript errors: Fix type issues
# - Import errors: Check file paths
# - Environment variables: Use SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION or vc env pull
```

### Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check deployment status via GitHub PR
gh pr view <pr_number> --json statusCheckRollup

# Check deployment logs (if deployment URL known)
vercel logs --follow <deployment_id>

# Common issues:
# - Environment variables missing in Vercel project settings
# - Build timeout (check vercel.json maxDuration)
# - Runtime errors (check function logs)
```

### Linting Issues (Biome)
```bash
# Auto-fix linting issues (Biome)
pnpm lint

# Format code (Biome)
pnpm format

# Manual fixes may be needed for:
# - TypeScript type errors
# - Unused variables
# - Import organization (Biome handles automatically)
# - Non-null assertions (allowed in this project)
# - Exhaustive dependencies (disabled for React hooks)

# Note: This project uses Biome, not ESLint/Prettier
# Configuration in biome.json, not .eslintrc or .prettierrc
```

### Worktree Issues
```bash
# Claude Code path restrictions - use subdirectories only
mkdir -p worktrees
git worktree add worktrees/<feature_name> -b jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Branch already exists error
git branch -D jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
git worktree add worktrees/<feature_name> -b jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Cleanup worktree after merge
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>
```

### Vercel CLI Issues
```bash
# Commands require confirmation
vercel ls --yes

# Use GitHub CLI for better integration
gh pr view <pr_number> --json statusCheckRollup
gh pr view <pr_number>  # Shows deployment links
```

### PR Merge & Cleanup Issues
```bash
# "branch checked out at worktree" error during merge
# Solution: Remove worktree first, then merge
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>
gh pr merge <pr_number> --squash --delete-branch

# "Cannot delete branch" error
# Solution: Ensure you're not in the worktree directory
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>
git branch -d jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# "failed to run git: fatal: 'main' is already checked out"
# Solution: Remove worktree before merging
git worktree list  # Check active worktrees
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>

# Worktree directory still exists after removal
# Solution: Manually remove directory if needed
rm -rf worktrees/<feature_name>

# Check merge status
gh pr view <pr_number> --json state,merged

# Main branch not up to date after merge
# Solution: Always pull after merging
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git log --oneline -5  # Verify your merged commit is present
```

### Main Branch Sync Issues
```bash
# Local main branch missing merged changes
# Solution: Always pull after PR merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Diverged main branch
# Check for local commits that weren't pushed
git status
git log --oneline origin/main..main  # Shows unpushed commits

# If you have local commits, push them first
git push origin main

# Then pull to get merged changes
git pull origin main
```

done
```

## Issue Templates

The project includes Claude Code-optimized issue templates designed for efficient AI-assisted development:

### Available Templates
1. **Feature Request** - For new features and enhancements
   - Action-oriented language ("What needs to be done?")
   - Browser-focused success criteria
   - File path hints for navigation
   - Browser testing checklist

2. **Bug Report** - For reporting browser issues
   - Browser-specific reproduction steps
   - Component path hints
   - Console error sections
   - Browser verification checkboxes

3. **Quick Task** - For simple, straightforward tasks
   - Minimal three-field structure
   - Task description, file location, test method
   - No unnecessary boilerplate

### Key Design Principles
- **Browser-only focus**: No OS/environment fields
- **AI-friendly language**: Clear, actionable descriptions
- **Path hints**: Help Claude Code navigate efficiently
- **File references**: Support for @-mentioning files (e.g., @src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx)
- **Minimal friction**: Only essential fields required

### Creating Issues
When creating issues, choose the appropriate template to provide Claude Code with:
- Clear starting points (file paths or @-mentions like @src/app/layout.tsx)
- Specific success criteria
- Browser-testable outcomes
- No irrelevant environment details

#### File References
You can reference files directly in issues using the @ symbol:
- `@src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx` - Reference specific files
- `@convex/messages.ts` - Reference backend files
- `@CLAUDE.md` - Reference documentation

This helps Claude Code quickly navigate to relevant files when working on the issue.

## Development Workflow Specifics

### Dual Server Development
- **Requires two dev servers**: Next.js + Convex backend
- Use `pnpm dev:all` for concurrent development or run in separate terminals
- Convex provides real-time database updates and subscriptions
- Environment variables must be synced between Next.js and Convex

### Quality Assurance
- **No testing framework configured** - relies on TypeScript + Biome
- Quality gates: Biome linting, TypeScript strict mode, environment validation
- Build validation prevents deployment with missing environment variables

### Deployment Integration
- Vercel deployment includes automatic Convex deployment
- Custom build command integrates both Next.js and Convex builds
- 30-second function timeout configured in vercel.json

## Environment Variables

Uses `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` for type-safe environment validation:

### Required Variables
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Required for Claude Sonnet 4
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for GPT models
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Convex backend URL

### Optional Variables
- `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` / `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - GitHub OAuth
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `JWKS` - Authentication tokens
- `SITE_URL` - Redirect handling

### Environment Sync
- Custom `./scripts/sync-env.sh` script validates and syncs variables
- Run `pnpm env:sync` after environment changes
- Use `pnpm env:check` to verify synced variables
- Color-coded output with success/error logging

## Notes

- Always work in worktrees for feature development
- Never commit without passing all quality gates
- Use GitHub MCP for issue/PR management
- Monitor deployments actively with Vercel CLI
- Clean up worktrees after features are merged
