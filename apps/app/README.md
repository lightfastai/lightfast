# TODO

- [ ] Add a compact toast component
- [ ] Create custom Dialog & Command components for EditorCommandDialog.
  - we have commented out the close button in the Dialog component, so we should add it back in.
  - we have made multiple changes to the Command component, so we should create a custom component for the EditorCommandDialog.
- [ ] Fix bug where if Property Inspector is open and I shift highlight on react-flow the property inspector gets highlighted too.
