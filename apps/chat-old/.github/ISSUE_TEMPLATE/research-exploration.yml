        ## Research & Exploration Issue
        
        This issue type is for documenting ongoing research, exploration, and system design investigations. Unlike traditional issues, these are living documents that evolve as we learn more. Claude Code and contributors should continuously update, refine, and expand the findings.
        
        ### Guidelines:
        - Focus on research and discovery, not implementation
        - Document findings, comparisons, and trade-offs
        - Update continuously as new information emerges
        - Use comments for major updates or direction changes
        - Keep theoretical until ready to implement

        ### How to Use This Issue:
        
        **Phase 1: Research & Discovery**
        1. Fill out initial structure with research question and findings
        2. Continuously edit description to add discoveries
        3. Use comments for major updates or pivots
        
        **Phase 2: Implementation**
        1. Create worktree and start building based on research
        2. Create PR with "Part of #<this_issue_number>" in description
        3. Keep implementation aligned with research findings
        
        **Phase 3: Post-Merge Updates**
        1. Update this issue after PR merges
        2. Document what was implemented
        3. Note remaining phases for future work
        
        This issue serves as both research document AND implementation tracker!
