# Cursor Rule Creation Guidelines

When creating new cursor rules, always follow this standard format and structure:

## Rule Format Template
```
---
description: [Brief description of what the rule covers]
globs: [File patterns this rule applies to, leave empty for global]
alwaysApply: [true/false - whether this rule should always be applied]
---

- [Primary instruction or guideline]
- [Secondary instruction with specific formatting requirements]
- [Additional context or examples]

@[reference-file.ts] // Include reference files when applicable
```

## Rule Creation Standards
- Use clear, descriptive names for the rule description
- Set `alwaysApply: true` for fundamental project standards
- Set `alwaysApply: false` for context-specific rules
- Use bullet points for instructions
- Reference template files with `@filename` syntax when applicable
- Keep rules focused and specific to avoid conflicts
- Use consistent formatting and language

## Example Rule Structure
Based on the RPC Service boilerplate pattern:
- Use descriptive service patterns when defining functionality
- Always use consistent naming conventions (e.g., snake_case for service names)
- Reference template files for implementation examples

## Best Practices
- Make rules actionable and specific
- Include examples when helpful
- Group related rules by functionality or domain
- Use glob patterns to target specific file types when appropriate
- Keep rule descriptions concise but informative
