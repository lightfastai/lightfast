## Why use Dahlia?

Creating beautiful web graphics requires understanding of art, design and graphics integration such as [WebGL](webglfundamentals.org) (or Three.js / R3F).

Dahlia, built on simple primitives called [Texture Operators](/texture-operators), allows you to create stunning graphics with ease, deploy and scale with confidence.

## FAQ

		Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawbacks of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._
