## What is Lightfast?
Lightfast is neural memory built for teams - an AI-powered platform that enables semantic search across your entire organization's knowledge. We index GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear, and other tools to provide instant answers with sources.

## Core Capabilities
- **Semantic search**: Find information by meaning, not just keywords
- **Source citations**: Every answer shows exactly where it came from
- **Real-time indexing**: Captures knowledge as it's created across your tools
- **Developer-first API**: Simple 4-route API (search, contents, similar, answer)
- **MCP tools**: Native integration with AI agents via Model Context Protocol
- **Privacy by default**: Complete tenant isolation, your data stays yours
