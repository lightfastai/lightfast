## What is Lightfast?
Lightfast is the memory layer for software teams. Engineers and AI agents use Lightfast to search everything an engineering organisation knows — code, pull requests, decisions, incidents, deployments, and docs — and get answers that always cite their sources. Every answer is grounded in real organisational data, not model guesswork.

## What Questions This Site Can Answer
Lightfast's documentation, blog, and changelog answer questions about: semantic search implementation for engineering teams, hybrid retrieval and vector database architecture, RAG pipeline design, MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for AI agents, reducing LLM token costs through retrieval instead of context stuffing, engineering team knowledge management, giving AI coding assistants persistent memory of a codebase, source-cited answer generation, and cross-tool search across GitHub, Vercel, Linear, and Sentry.

## Core Capabilities
- **Semantic search**: Find information by meaning, not just keywords
- **Source citations**: Every answer shows exactly where it came from
- **Real-time indexing**: Captures knowledge as it's created across your tools
- **Developer-first API**: Six-route API (search, contents, findsimilar, graph, related, answer)
- **MCP tools**: Native integration with AI agents via Model Context Protocol
- **Privacy by default**: Complete tenant isolation, your data stays yours
