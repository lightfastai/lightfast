# Chat System Edge Cases & Recovery Patterns

This directory contains documentation for edge cases that are NOT already handled by the existing robust architecture.

## Already Implemented âœ…

- **Stream Resume**: Full activeStreamId tracking with GET endpoint recovery
- **Optimistic Updates**: Sophisticated tRPC cache with duplicate prevention
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive ChatErrorHandler with typed error responses  
- **Session Management**: Proper creation, tracking, and authentication
- **Background Sync**: Automatic cache invalidation for eventual consistency
- **Multi-layer Memory**: PlanetScale (auth) + Redis (anonymous) with proper fallbacks

## Edge Case Categories

### [UI State Mismatches](./ui-state-mismatches/)
Cases where frontend state diverges from actual system state despite optimistic updates.
- **[Orphaned User Messages](./ui-state-mismatches/orphaned-user-messages.md)** - User message visible but no response generated

### [Cache Inconsistencies](./cache-inconsistencies/) 
Scenarios where tRPC cache gets out of sync despite invalidation mechanisms.
- **[Optimistic Update Rollback Failure](./cache-inconsistencies/optimistic-update-rollback-failure.md)** - Failed API calls leave stale optimistic updates

### [Authentication Edge Cases](./auth-edge-cases/)
Auth state changes that occur during active operations.
- **[Mid-Stream Auth Expiry](./auth-edge-cases/mid-stream-auth-expiry.md)** - Token expires during long streaming responses

### [Model Provider Failures](./model-provider-failures/)
AI model providers returning invalid or dangerous content.
- **[Malformed Streaming Response](./model-provider-failures/malformed-streaming-response.md)** - Corrupted streams breaking client parser

### [Database Failures](./database-failures/)
Database constraint violations and transaction failures.
- **[Constraint Violation Recovery](./database-failures/constraint-violation-recovery.md)** - Foreign key violations, data too large, encoding errors

### [Race Conditions](./race-conditions/)
Timing issues from rapid user actions or concurrent operations.
- **[Rapid Model Switching](./race-conditions/rapid-model-switching.md)** - Model changes during active streaming

### [Partial Failures](./partial-failures/)
Cases where some operations succeed while others fail in the same transaction.
- **[Usage Tracking Desync](./partial-failures/usage-tracking-desync.md)** - Billing/quota inconsistencies between frontend and backend

## Implementation Priority

1. **Orphaned User Message Detection** - Most user-visible issue, simple fix
2. **Optimistic Update Rollback** - Data consistency critical, affects user trust
3. **Mid-Stream Auth Expiry** - Causes data loss, frustrating user experience  
4. **Database Constraint Recovery** - Prevents permanent data loss with clear recovery paths
5. **Model Provider Validation** - Security and stability concerns
6. **Model Switching Race Conditions** - User confusion about which model is responding
7. **Usage Tracking Desync** - Billing accuracy important but less immediately visible

## Testing Strategy

Each edge case includes:
- **Reproduction steps** for manual testing
- **Automated test scenarios** for CI/CD
- **Recovery verification** to ensure graceful handling
- **User experience impact** assessment

## Recovery Patterns

- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial functionality with clear user communication
- **Background Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **User-Initiated Recovery**: Clear retry/refresh actions
- **State Reconciliation**: Smart merge of conflicting states
