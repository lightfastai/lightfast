/**
 * Organization access utilities using Clerk RBAC
 *
 * This module provides Clerk-based organization access control, replacing
 * custom database queries with Clerk's built-in organization context and RBAC.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Clerk organizations are linked to Deus organizations via clerkOrgId
 * - User's active organization is tracked by Clerk (orgId from auth())
 * - Roles are managed by Clerk (orgRole from auth())
 * - We still query Deus database for GitHub-specific data
 *
 * @see org-access.ts - Legacy database-only access control
