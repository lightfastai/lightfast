# Deus - AI Workflow Orchestration Platform

## Mission

Build a general-purpose agent orchestration platform that connects AI to any tool via natural language, enabling anyone to automate complex workflows without code.

## Core Goals

### Product Architecture

- **Integration Layer**: Universal MCP-first protocol supporting 500+ tools (APIs, CLIs, databases, internal systems)
- **Workflow Engine**: AI-native orchestration with multi-step workflows, conditional logic, and error recovery
- **Agent Intelligence**: Natural language → executable workflows with context awareness and learning from failures
- **Sandbox Execution**: Secure, isolated environments (Browserbase, Fly.io) for safe tool execution
- **Marketplace Platform**: Community-driven integration and workflow ecosystem with revenue sharing
- **Developer SDK**: Simple APIs for building custom integrations and hosting MCP servers

### Target Market

- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Dev founders shipping products (v0.dev users, indie hackers, technical founders)
- **Phase 2**: Engineering teams at startups (5-50 person companies)
- **Phase 3**: Integration developers (SaaS companies wanting AI-native integrations)
- **Phase 4**: Enterprises with custom internal tools
- **Positioning**: "Vercel for AI agent workflows" - the platform where any tool becomes AI-orchestrable

### Competitive Advantage

- **vs Zapier/Make** (no-code automation): AI-native workflows that understand intent, not just trigger-action
- **vs n8n** (low-code automation): Conversational interface, auto-healing, learns from production
- **vs Vercel Integrations**: Not just connections, but autonomous orchestration across tools
- **vs Claude/ChatGPT** (general AI): Purpose-built for developer workflows with stateful context
- **Core differentiation**: MCP-first architecture + AI workflow compilation + marketplace ecosystem

### Business Model

#### Phase 1-2: Free to Paid (SaaS)

- **Free**: 5 integrations, 100 workflow runs/month
- **Pro** ($29/mo): Unlimited integrations, 1000 runs/month, priority support
- **Team** ($99/mo): Shared workflows, collaboration, audit logs
- **Enterprise** (Custom): SSO, private integrations, SLA, dedicated support

#### Phase 3-4: Platform Economics

- **Marketplace Revenue**: 70% to integration developers, 30% platform fee
- **Usage-Based**: Additional workflow runs beyond plan limits ($0.10/run)
- **Hosting**: MCP server hosting for integration developers ($49/mo per server)
- **White-Label**: License Deus for enterprises ($50k-$200k/year)

#### Revenue Model Evolution

- **Year 1**: SaaS subscriptions (80%), usage (20%)
- **Year 2**: SaaS (60%), marketplace (25%), usage (15%)
- **Year 3**: SaaS (40%), marketplace (35%), enterprise (20%), usage (5%)

### Long-Term Vision

#### Near-term (2025-2026): Developer Workflow Automation

Become the standard way dev teams ship products - from idea to production, orchestrated by AI.

#### Mid-term (2027-2028): Universal Work Automation

Expand beyond dev tools to any professional workflow - sales, marketing, finance, operations. 1000+ integrations, 100k+ users.

#### Long-term (2029+): Ambient AI Operating System

Every digital tool becomes AI-orchestrable via MCP. Deus becomes the execution layer for personal and business AI agents.

**Vision**: "Jarvis for everyone" - your AI assistant that can actually do things across your entire digital world.

### Strategic Position in Lightfast Ecosystem

- **Lightfast Core**: Agent execution engine (infrastructure)
- **Deus**: Agent orchestration platform (application layer)
- **Synergy**: Deus runs on Lightfast's execution engine, proving the platform's capabilities while generating revenue to fund core R&D

### Ultimate Goal

Use commercial success from Deus to fund Lightfast's AGI research - building the reasoning and execution capabilities for human-level AI that can orchestrate arbitrary tasks across any domain.

## Product Principles

### 1. MCP is the Universal Language

Every integration speaks Model Context Protocol. Build adapters for legacy APIs, but push ecosystem toward MCP-native.

### 2. AI-Native, Not No-Code

Don't make users build workflows in visual editors. Let them describe intent, Deus figures out how.

### 3. Context Over Configuration

Deus understands your project, your team, your patterns. Suggestions get smarter over time.

### 4. Marketplace-First Growth

Community-contributed integrations and workflows accelerate adoption faster than we could build alone.

### 5. Production is the Benchmark

Following eval philosophy - optimize for real user success, not vanity metrics. Every failure becomes a learning opportunity.

### 6. Security by Design

Sandboxed execution, scoped credentials, audit logs, human-in-the-loop for critical actions.

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1: Product-Market Fit (Months 0-6)

- **Primary**: 100 active users, 50% create custom workflows, 80% MoM retention
- **Secondary**: Average 3 integrations/user, 10 workflows executed/user/week
- **Qualitative**: Users say "I can't imagine shipping without Deus"

### Phase 2: Integration Ecosystem (Months 6-18)

- **Primary**: 50 integrations, 10 community-built, 1000 active users
- **Secondary**: $10k MRR, 500 workflows created, 100k runs/month
- **Qualitative**: First integration developer makes $1k/month from marketplace

### Phase 3: Marketplace Momentum (Months 18-36)

- **Primary**: 200+ integrations, 50+ developers, $100k MRR, 10k users
- **Secondary**: $100k/mo marketplace GMV, 10k+ workflows, 1M+ runs/month
- **Qualitative**: Companies choose tools based on Deus integration availability

### Phase 4: Platform Leader (Year 3+)

- **Primary**: 500+ integrations, 100k users, $1M+ MRR
- **Secondary**: Category leader in "AI workflow platforms"
- **Qualitative**: "Deus" becomes a verb ("just Deus that workflow")

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **MCP adoption slow**: Build adapters for top 100 tools ourselves
- **LLM workflow hallucinations**: Validation engine + human-in-the-loop + learning system
- **Multi-tool reliability**: Circuit breakers, retries, transactional workflows
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Sandboxed execution, regular audits, bug bounty

### Market Risks

- **Zapier defensively responds**: Our AI-native workflows are fundamentally different
- **Claude/OpenAI build similar**: We have MCP ecosystem head start + developer focus
- **Integration partners block us**: Build around them, community will build alternatives
- **Low willingness to pay**: Free tier drives adoption, enterprise drives revenue

### Execution Risks

- **Scope creep**: Ship Phase 1 with 6 tools, prove value before expanding
- **Marketplace chicken-egg**: Seed with 20 verified integrations before opening to community
- **Technical debt**: Built on Lightfast's proven execution engine, not building from scratch
- **Team capacity**: Focus ruthlessly on developer workflows, not general automation
