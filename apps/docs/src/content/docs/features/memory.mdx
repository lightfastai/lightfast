# Memory Organization

Lightfast structures your engineering org's knowledge into four complementary layers, each optimized for different types of retrieval and reasoning. This organization enables both precise lookups and broad exploration.

## Chunks: Durable Document Slices

When you index a long document—like a comprehensive API guide or lengthy RFC—Lightfast automatically breaks it into semantic chunks. Each chunk:

- **Represents a coherent section**: Natural breaks at headings, topic shifts, or logical boundaries
- **Maintains context**: Includes references to the source document, section hierarchy, and surrounding chunks
- **Enables precision**: Allows specific paragraphs to rank highly without forcing you to read entire documents

**Example:** A 5000-word architecture document becomes 12 chunks. When you search "database migration strategy," only the relevant 2 chunks surface—not the entire document. Each result links back to the full context.

### How Chunking Works

Lightfast uses semantic analysis to determine chunk boundaries:

1. **Respect document structure**: Headings, code blocks, and section breaks guide chunking
2. **Maintain coherence**: Each chunk represents a complete thought or concept
3. **Preserve context**: Chunks include metadata about their position in the document hierarchy
4. **Link relationships**: Chunks reference previous and next sections for navigation

**Chunking benefits:**
- Find specific sections of long documents without reading everything
- Get precise answers with minimal noise
- Navigate to full document context when needed
- Search remains fast even with thousands of pages

## Observations: Atomic Moments

Observations capture discrete events that provide critical context for decisions and changes:

- **Decisions**: "We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for ACID guarantees" (from RFC discussion)
- **Incidents**: "API latency spike resolved by adding Redis cache" (from post-mortem)
- **Highlights**: "New authentication flow approved by security team" (from PR review)

Each observation is structured with:
- **Content**: What happened or was decided
- **Context**: Why it matters and what problem it solved
- **People**: Contributors, reviewers, and stakeholders involved
- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Relationships**: Links to related PRs, issues, or documents

Observations make it easy to answer questions like "Why did we make this choice?" or "When did we decide to deprecate this API?"

### Creating Observations

Observations can be:

1. **Automatically extracted**: Lightfast identifies key moments from PR discussions, issue resolutions, and meeting notes
2. **Manually captured**: Teams can tag important decisions or highlights
3. **Inferred from patterns**: System changes, deployment events, and incident timelines generate observations

**Use cases:**
- Trace decision rationale months or years later
- Understand what problems were solved and why
- Find stakeholders who were involved in key decisions
- Build institutional knowledge that survives team changes

## Summaries: Clustered Rollups

Summaries aggregate related content to provide high-level overviews without losing detail:

**Organization dimensions:**
- **By entity**: Per-person activity summaries, per-repo changelogs, per-project status reports
- **By topic**: Grouped by semantic similarity—all authentication-related work, all performance optimizations
- **By time**: Daily digests of changes, weekly progress reports, monthly retrospectives

Summaries help you quickly understand "What happened with the payment service this month?" or "What has Alice been working on?" without reading dozens of individual PRs and issues.

<Alert>
**Summaries link to source material.** Every summary includes citations to the underlying chunks, observations, and original documents. You can verify claims and dive deeper when needed.

### Summary Types

**Activity summaries:**
- Who worked on what and when
- Major contributions and impacts
- Collaboration patterns

**Topical summaries:**
- All work related to a specific theme (e.g., authentication, performance)
- Cross-repo implementations of similar patterns
- Evolution of design decisions over time

**Temporal summaries:**
- What changed in a given time period
- Sprint or milestone progress reports
- Quarterly retrospectives and trends

**Use cases:**
- Onboard new software team members quickly
- Prepare for planning meetings
- Write status updates and reports
- Identify patterns and trends

## Profiles: Per-Entity Context

Profiles are learned representations of people, repositories, and projects based on their activity and contributions:

**Profile components:**
- **Expertise areas**: Topics and technologies someone frequently works with
- **Code ownership**: Parts of the codebase they maintain or contribute to heavily
- **Interaction patterns**: What discussions they participate in, who they collaborate with
- **Contribution history**: Timeline of their involvement across repos and projects

Profiles enable personalized search results and help answer "Who should I ask about X?" queries. When you search, Lightfast can boost results related to your areas of expertise or surface content from people you frequently collaborate with.

### How Profiles Work

Profiles are built from:

1. **Contribution data**: Commits, PRs, reviews, and comments
2. **Semantic analysis**: Topics and technologies in their work
3. **Collaboration networks**: Who they work with and on what
4. **Temporal patterns**: Activity levels and focus areas over time

**Profile applications:**
- **Personalized search**: Results weighted by your expertise and interests
- **Expert finding**: Identify the right person to ask about a topic
- **Software team insights**: Understand collaboration patterns and knowledge distribution
- **Succession planning**: Identify backup owners for critical areas

**Example queries enabled by profiles:**
- "Who knows about the payment service?" → Find top contributors and reviewers
- "What does Alice specialize in?" → Show her expertise areas and recent work
- "Who should review this auth change?" → Identify security-focused reviewers

## How Memory Layers Work Together

The four memory types complement each other:

1. **Chunks** provide granular, precise retrieval of specific content
2. **Observations** capture atomic moments and decision rationale
3. **Summaries** offer aggregated views across time, topics, and entities
4. **Profiles** enable personalization and expert finding

**Example workflow:**

- **Search**: "Why did we migrate to PostgreSQL?"
- **Chunks**: Find specific paragraphs from the RFC discussing ACID requirements
- **Observations**: Surface the decision moment with stakeholders and reasoning
- **Summaries**: Show all database-related work that quarter
- **Profiles**: Identify who led the migration and has ongoing expertise
