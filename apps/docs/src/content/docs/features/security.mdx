# Privacy & Security

Lightfast is built with privacy and security as core principles. Your team's data stays isolated, access controls are enforced, and all activity is auditable.

## Tenant Isolation

Every workspace operates in complete isolation from other organizations. Your data never mixes with content from other teams.

### Complete Workspace Separation

**Database isolation:**
- Each workspace has its own tables in the database layer
- Queries are scoped by workspace ID at the database level
- No cross-workspace joins or queries possible
- Row-level security enforces isolation

**Namespaced embeddings:**
- Vector indexes are partitioned by workspace ID in Pinecone
- Separate namespaces prevent cross-contamination
- Queries never search across workspace boundaries
- Index isolation at the infrastructure level

**Isolated caches:**
- Redis caches are prefixed by workspace ID
- Cache keys include workspace identifier
- No shared cache entries between workspaces
- Cache eviction is workspace-scoped

**Independent calibration:**
- Ranking weights tune per workspace
- Quality metrics measured separately
- Feedback loops operate in isolation
- No cross-workspace learning or model sharing

### Why This Matters

**Security:**
- Vulnerabilities affect one workspace, not all
- Breaches cannot leak data across organizations
- Attack surface limited to single tenant

**Privacy:**
- Your usage patterns never influence other software teams
- Query data stays completely private
- No cross-organization analytics or reporting

**Compliance:**
- Meet data residency requirements per workspace
- Separate retention policies per organization
- Audit trail isolation for compliance reviews

**Performance:**
- No "noisy neighbor" problems
- Resource allocation per workspace
- Predictable query performance

<Alert>
**Zero trust architecture.** Even internal Lightfast systems authenticate and authorize every workspace operation. No implicit trust between components—every request is validated.
</Alert>

## Access Control

Lightfast respects the access controls of your connected repositories and tools. If you can't see it in GitHub, you can't find it in Lightfast.

### Permission Inheritance

**GitHub permissions:**
- Only content you can view in GitHub is indexed for you
- Private repos require appropriate access
- Organization membership determines visibility
- Team-based access controls are honored

**Per-user filtering:**
- Search results are filtered based on individual permissions
- No user sees content they lack access to
- Permissions checked at query time, not index time
- Real-time updates when access changes

**Dynamic access checks:**
- If permissions change (repo made private, access revoked), content disappears from results immediately
- No stale results from previously accessible content
- Webhooks and sync jobs keep permissions current

**Software team visibility:**
- Software team members only see content from repositories they have access to
- Workspace admins see aggregated metrics, not restricted content
- Invitation-based access to workspace features

### Permission Example

Alice has access to `repo-a` and `repo-b`. Bob only has access to `repo-a`.

**Scenario:** Both search for "authentication"

**Alice sees results from:**
- `repo-a/docs/auth.md`
- `repo-a/src/auth/`
- `repo-b/auth-service/`
- PR discussions from both repos

**Bob sees results from:**
- `repo-a/docs/auth.md`
- `repo-a/src/auth/`
- (No results from `repo-b`)

Alice and Bob are in the same workspace, but see different results based on their individual GitHub permissions.

### Permission Enforcement

**At indexing:**
- Content is tagged with required permissions
- Access control lists stored with each document
- Organization and team membership recorded

**At query time:**
- User's GitHub token validated
- Permissions fetched from GitHub API
- Results filtered before ranking
- Only accessible content enters result set

**On permission changes:**
- GitHub webhooks notify Lightfast of access changes
- Content re-indexed or removed as needed
- User sessions invalidated when access revoked
- Results update within minutes

## Data Security

### Encryption

**At rest:**
- Database encrypted with AES-256
- S3 document storage encrypted
- Pinecone indexes encrypted
- Redis cache encrypted in transit and at rest

**In transit:**
- All API traffic uses TLS 1.3
- Internal service communication encrypted
- Database connections use SSL/TLS
- No plaintext data transmission

### Authentication

**API authentication:**
- API keys with workspace-scoped access
- Keys can be rotated without downtime
- Rate limiting per key to prevent abuse
- Automatic key expiration for security

**User authentication:**
- OAuth via GitHub (or other providers)
- No passwords stored in Lightfast systems
- Multi-factor authentication supported
- Session tokens with configurable TTL

**Service authentication:**
- Mutual TLS for internal services
- Service accounts with minimal permissions
- Credential rotation enforced
- Audit logs for all service access

### Network Security

**Infrastructure:**
- VPC isolation for production services
- Private subnets for databases
- Security groups restrict traffic
- WAF protects API endpoints

**DDoS protection:**
- Cloudflare or similar CDN
- Rate limiting at multiple layers
- Auto-scaling handles traffic spikes
- Graceful degradation under load

## Audit & Compliance

Full query audit trail enables compliance and security reviews.

### Query Logs

**What's logged:**
- Every search, retrieval, and answer request
- User ID and workspace ID
- Timestamp and query parameters
- Results returned and citations shown
- API key used (if applicable)

**Retention:**
- Configurable per workspace (30-365 days)
- Longer retention available for enterprise
- Automatic archival to cold storage
- Deletion after retention period

**Access:**
- Workspace admins can download logs
- API for programmatic access
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Export to SIEM tools

### Access Logs

**What's tracked:**
- Which users accessed which documents
- Timestamp and access method
- Source IP and user agent
- Results clicked and citations followed

**Use cases:**
- Security investigations
- Compliance audits
- Usage analytics
- Anomaly detection

### Compliance Features

- Annual audits by independent firms
- Evidence collection automated
- Security controls documented
- Continuous monitoring

**GDPR compliance:**
- Data deletion on request
- Export user data in portable format
- Consent management for analytics
- Privacy-by-design architecture

**Data residency:**
- Workspace data stays in specified region

- Regional deployment options (US, EU)

**Retention policies:**
- Configure document retention per workspace

- Exceptions for legal hold
- Audit trail of deletions

<Alert>
**SOC 2 Type II compliance.** Lightfast undergoes regular security audits and maintains SOC 2 Type II certification. Enterprise customers can request compliance documentation and security questionnaires.

## Security Best Practices

### For Workspace Administrators

**Access management:**
- Review workspace members regularly
- Remove former employees promptly
- Use GitHub organization for SSO
- Enforce MFA for all software team members

**API key hygiene:**
- Rotate keys quarterly
- Use separate keys per environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Revoke unused keys
- Monitor key usage in audit logs

**Compliance:**
- Review audit logs monthly
- Configure retention to meet requirements
- Document data handling in privacy policy
- Test incident response procedures

### For Developers

**Secure integration:**
- Store API keys in environment variables, not code
- Use HTTPS for all API requests
- Implement proper error handling
- Respect rate limits

**Data handling:**
- Don't log query results containing sensitive data
- Sanitize user inputs before querying
- Implement client-side rate limiting
- Cache responses appropriately (with TTL)
