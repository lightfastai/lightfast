# Config

The `lightfast.yml` file controls what gets indexed from your repository and how Lightfast organizes your engineering knowledge. This guide covers all configuration options and best practices.

## Quick Start

Get started with the minimal configuration:

```yaml
version: 1
include:
  - "docs/**/*.md"
```

That's it! This config will index all Markdown files in your `docs/` directory.

<Alert>
**Next steps:** Place this file in your repository root as `lightfast.yml`, then add more file patterns below.
</Alert>

## Config File Location

Place your `lightfast.yml` file in the **root directory** of your repository. Lightfast automatically detects this file when your repository is connected and uses it to determine what to index.

```bash
your-repository/
├── lightfast.yml          # Configuration file
├── README.md
├── docs/
│   ├── api/
│   └── guides/
└── src/
```

## Core Concepts

### version (required)

The configuration version. Currently only version `1` is supported.

```yaml
version: 1
```

### include (required)

Array of glob patterns matching files to index. Patterns are relative to your repository root and use standard glob syntax.

**Glob Pattern Syntax:**
- `*` - Matches any characters except `/`
- `**` - Matches any characters including `/` (recursive)
- `?` - Matches any single character except `/`
- `[abc]` - Matches any character in the set

```yaml
include:
  - "README.md"              # Specific file
  - "docs/**/*.md"           # All .md files in docs/ recursively
  - "**/*.mdx"               # All .mdx files anywhere
  - "rfcs/**/*"              # All files in rfcs/ directory
  - "guides/*.{md,mdx}"      # .md and .mdx files in guides/
  - "src/**/*.tsx"           # All TypeScript React files
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use specific patterns to avoid indexing unnecessary files
- Start with documentation files (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`)
- Consider including design documents and RFCs
- Test patterns locally before committing

## Configuration Reference

Quick reference for all available options:

| Field | Required | Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `version` | ✅ | number | Must be `1` | Configuration schema version |
| `include` | ✅ | string[] | Valid glob patterns (relative paths), minimum 1 pattern | Array of glob patterns matching files to index |

**Automatic Exclusions:** `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.turbo/`, dotfiles

## Pattern Selection Guide

Choose the right patterns for your use case:

### Documentation Sites
**Use when:** You have a dedicated docs folder with Markdown/MDX files

```yaml
version: 1
include:
  - "docs/**/*.md"
  - "docs/**/*.mdx"
  - "README.md"
```

### Engineering Wikis
**Use when:** You maintain design docs, RFCs, and runbooks

```yaml
version: 1
include:
  - "wiki/**/*.md"
  - "rfcs/**/*.md"
  - "adrs/**/*.md"
  - "runbooks/**/*.md"
```

### API Documentation
**Use when:** You have OpenAPI specs and API reference docs

```yaml
version: 1
include:
  - "api/**/*.md"
  - "openapi.yaml"
  - "swagger.json"
  - "README.md"
```

### Monorepo Documentation
**Use when:** Each package has its own documentation

```yaml
version: 1
include:
  - "README.md"
  - "docs/**/*.md"
  - "packages/*/README.md"
  - "apps/*/README.md"
```

**Warning:** Large codebases with many source files may hit indexing limits. Start with documentation files and expand as needed.

## Validation and Errors

Lightfast validates your configuration when indexing starts. Common errors:

### No Include Patterns

<ValidationError title="No Include Patterns">
At least one include pattern is required
</ValidationError>

**Fix:** Add at least one glob pattern to the `include` array.

### Invalid Glob Pattern

<ValidationErrorList
  title="Invalid Glob Pattern"
  errors={[
    "Pattern '/absolute/path/*.md' should not start with /",
    "Pattern 'C:\\docs\\*.md' appears to be an absolute path"
  ]}
/>

**Fix:** Use relative paths from repository root (e.g., `docs/*.md` instead of `/docs/*.md` or `C:\docs\*.md`).

## Testing Your Configuration

Before committing, test your glob patterns locally:

```bash
# Install fast-glob globally
npm install -g fast-glob-cli

# Test your patterns
fast-glob "docs/**/*.md" "**/*.mdx" --cwd /path/to/repo
```

This shows which files will be matched by your patterns.

## Updating Configuration

To update your configuration:

1. Edit `lightfast.yml` in your repository
2. Commit and push changes
3. Lightfast automatically detects updates and re-indexes

```bash
git add lightfast.yml
git commit -m "Update Lightfast configuration"
git push origin main
```

Changes take effect within minutes. Previous indexed content from removed patterns will be automatically cleaned up.
