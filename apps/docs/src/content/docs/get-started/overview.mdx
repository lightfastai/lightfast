# Memory built for teams

Search everything your team knows. Get answers with sources.

## What is Lightfast?

Lightfast is a memory system built for teams. It indexes your code, docs, tickets, and conversations so people and AI agents can search by meaning, get answers with sources, and trace decisions across your organization.

It helps people and AI agents:

- **Search by meaning** - Find information based on intent, not just keywords
- **Get answers with citations** - Every answer shows where it came from
- **Trace decisions** - See who owns what, what depends on what, and why decisions were made
- **Integrate anywhere** - Four simple API routes. MCP tools for agents. Works in minutes.

## How It Works

### 1. Index Your Knowledge

Lightfast automatically indexes content from across your organization:

- **GitHub**: Pull requests, issues, discussions, code, wikis
- **Linear**: Issues, comments, projects
- **Notion**: Pages and databases
- **Slack**: Messages and threads (with permissions)
- **Discord**: Messages and threads
- **Custom sources**: Any content via API

### 2. Search by Meaning

Unlike keyword search, Lightfast understands context:

```typescript
// Ask a question in natural language
const results = await lf.search({
  query: 'how does authentication work in our system?'
})

// Get relevant results even if exact keywords don't match
// Finds: "OAuth 2.0 implementation", "login security", "user session management"
```

### 3. Get Answers with Sources

Generate synthesized answers that cite their sources:

```typescript
const answer = await lf.answer({
  query: 'explain our deployment process',
  maxSources: 5
})

console.log(answer.data.answer)
// "The deployment process involves..."

console.log(answer.data.citations)
// [{ title: "Deployment Guide", url: "...", relevance: 0.95 }, ...]
```

## Configuration

Define what gets indexed and remembered with a simple YAML config:

```yaml
# Lightfast Configuration
# Docs: https://lightfast.ai/docs/get-started/overview

version: 1

# Store name (unique identifier for this documentation set)
store: root-store

# Files to include (glob patterns)
include:
  - "README.md"
  - "docs/**/*.md"
  - "**/*.ts"

# Files to exclude (optional)
exclude:
  - "**/node_modules/**"
  - "**/.git/**"
```

## The Four API Routes

Lightfast provides everything you need in four simple endpoints:

### POST /v1/search
Search and rank results by meaning with optional rationale and highlights.

```typescript
const results = await lf.search({
  query: 'authentication implementation',
  limit: 10,
  includeRationale: true
})
```

### POST /v1/contents
Get full documents, metadata, and relationships.

```typescript
const docs = await lf.contents({
  ids: [results.data[0].id],
  includeRelationships: true
})
```

### POST /v1/similar
Find related content based on semantic similarity.

```typescript
const similar = await lf.similar({
  id: results.data[0].id,
  limit: 5
})
```

### POST /v1/answer
Get synthesized answers with citations (supports streaming).

```typescript
const answer = await lf.answer({
  query: 'how does our payment system work?',
  stream: true
})
```

## Key Features

### Search by Meaning
Understands intent and context, not just keyword matching. Searching for "authentication refactor" finds PRs about "OAuth 2.0", issues discussing "login security", and docs on "user session management".

### Always Cite Sources
Every answer includes citations showing where information came from. No black-box responses.

### Explainable by Design
See who owns what, what depends on what, and why results are ranked the way they are.

### Privacy by Default
Complete tenant isolation. Your data stays yours. Respects source permissions.

## Use Cases

### Team Knowledge Bot
Build a Slack or Discord bot that answers questions using your team's knowledge.

### Code Context Assistant
Help developers find relevant code changes, discussions, and decisions.

### Decision Tracking
Trace why decisions were made and who was involved.

### Onboarding Assistant
Help new team members learn about your systems and processes.

### Documentation Search
Make your docs instantly searchable with semantic understanding.

## What Makes Lightfast Different?

### Hybrid Retrieval
Combines semantic search, lexical matching, graph relationships, recency, and importance for accurate results.

### Multi-View Embeddings
Creates multiple representations of each document (title, snippet, body, summary) for better recall.

### Short-Hop Graph Reasoning
Maintains 1-2 hop relationships for explainable, bounded reasoning about ownership and dependencies.

### Continuous Quality Improvement
Measures recall@K, rerank lift, and faithfulness. Tunes per-workspace ranking weights based on usage.
