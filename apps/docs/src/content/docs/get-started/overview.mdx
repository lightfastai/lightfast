# Lightfast Core

Lightfast Core is a production-ready AI agent framework built on top of Vercel AI SDK. It provides a streamlined, type-safe way to build AI agents with advanced features like memory management, tool factories, and provider-specific optimizations.

## Why Lightfast Core?

Building production AI agents requires more than just calling an LLM API. You need:

- **Stateful conversations** - Manage conversation history across sessions
- **Context-aware tools** - Tools that can access runtime context like user IDs and session data
- **Provider optimizations** - Leverage provider-specific features like Anthropic's prompt caching
- **Production-ready handlers** - Battle-tested request handlers for Next.js and other frameworks
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support with strong typing throughout

Lightfast Core provides all of this in a clean, composable API that integrates seamlessly with your existing stack.

## Core Architecture

Lightfast Core is built around three main concepts:

### 1. Agents
Agents are the core abstraction that combines a language model with tools, memory, and system prompts. They handle the complexity of managing conversations while providing a simple streaming interface.

```typescript
const agent = createAgent({
  name: "assistant",
  system: "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
  model: gateway("anthropic/claude-4-sonnet"),
  tools: myTools,
  createRuntimeContext: ({ sessionId, resourceId }) => ({
    userId: resourceId,
    sessionId,
  }),
});
```

### 2. Tools with Runtime Context
Unlike traditional tools, Lightfast tools can access runtime context like user IDs, session data, and request information. This enables building secure, context-aware tools without global state.

```typescript
const searchTool = createTool({
  description: "Search the web",
  inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ query }, context) => {
    // Access runtime context in tool execution
    console.log("User:", context.userId);
    return performSearch(query);
  },
});
```

### 3. Memory Adapters
Memory adapters provide persistent conversation history with support for different backends. The framework includes Redis and in-memory adapters out of the box.

```typescript
const memory = new RedisMemory({
  url: process.env.REDIS_URL,
  token: process.env.REDIS_TOKEN,
});
```

## Key Features

- **🚀 Production Ready** - Battle-tested in production environments
- **🔒 Type Safe** - Full TypeScript support with inference
- **⚡ Provider Optimized** - Leverage Anthropic caching, OpenAI streaming, and more
- **🛠 Extensible** - Easy to add custom tools, memory adapters, and handlers
- **📊 Observable** - Built-in support for Braintrust, OpenTelemetry, and custom logging
- **🔐 Secure** - Context isolation, rate limiting, and authentication support

## Quick Example

Here's a complete example of creating and using an agent:

```typescript
import { createAgent } from "@lightfast/core/agent";
import { fetchRequestHandler } from "@lightfast/core/agent/handlers";
import { RedisMemory } from "@lightfast/core/agent/memory/adapters/redis";
import { gateway } from "@ai-sdk/gateway";

// Create your agent
const agent = createAgent({
  name: "assistant",
  system: "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
  model: gateway("openai/gpt-5-nano"),
  tools: {
    // Tools can be defined inline or imported
    search: webSearchTool,
  },
  createRuntimeContext: ({ sessionId, resourceId }) => ({
    userId: resourceId,
    sessionId,
  }),
});

// Handle requests in your API route
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { userId } = await auth();
  
  return fetchRequestHandler({
    agent,
    sessionId: "session-123",
    memory: new RedisMemory({ /* config */ }),
    req,
    resourceId: userId,
  });
}
```
