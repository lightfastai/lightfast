# Safari Compatibility Guide for Landing Page

## Overview
The landing page CSS contains several features that have compatibility issues with Safari (both desktop and iOS). This document outlines the issues and the implemented fixes.

## Major Safari Compatibility Issues

### 1. **CSS color-mix() Function**
**Issue**: Safari only supports `color-mix()` from version 16.2+, and older versions fail silently.
**Fix**: Implemented fallback using CSS custom properties and JavaScript-based state management.

### 2. **Complex calc() with CSS Variables**
**Issue**: Safari struggles with nested `calc()` functions that reference other CSS variables.
**Fix**: Simplified calculations and used JavaScript to set viewport dimensions directly.

### 3. **iOS Safari Scroll Lock**
**Issue**: iOS Safari's elastic scrolling breaks standard scroll lock implementations.
**Fix**: Custom iOS-specific scroll lock using fixed positioning and touch event prevention.

### 4. **Viewport Units (100vh)**
**Issue**: In Safari, 100vh includes the browser UI chrome, causing layout issues.
**Fix**: JavaScript-based viewport height calculation that accounts for Safari's UI.

### 5. **will-change Property Performance**
**Issue**: Overuse of `will-change` causes rendering issues and poor performance in Safari.
**Fix**: Selective application of `will-change` only where necessary.

## Implementation Details

### CSS Fixes (`landing-safari-fixes.css`)
- Feature detection using `@supports` queries
- Safari-specific selectors using `-webkit-appearance`
- Simplified animations for mobile Safari
- Touch-optimized input handling

### JavaScript Fixes (`safari-compatibility.ts`)
- Browser detection utilities
- Dynamic viewport height adjustment
- iOS-specific scroll behavior handling
- Performance optimizations for animations

### Integration Points
1. **AnimationProvider**: Initializes Safari fixes on mount
2. **useScrollLock**: Uses Safari-specific scroll locking
3. **LeaderCard**: Applies color transitions via data attributes

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Desktop Safari 14+
- [ ] iOS Safari 14+
- [ ] iPad Safari (landscape/portrait)
- [ ] Safari with reduced motion preference
- [ ] Safari private browsing mode

## Known Limitations
1. Safari versions < 14 may have degraded animations
2. Some CSS features gracefully degrade rather than fully polyfill
3. Performance on older iOS devices may be reduced

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using Intersection Observer for animation triggers
2. Implement progressive enhancement for newer Safari features
3. Add performance monitoring for Safari-specific issues
