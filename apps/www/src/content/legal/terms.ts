## 1. Agreement to Terms

By using any portion of the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.

We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we'll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site and/or may also send other communications. It's important that you review the Terms whenever we update them, or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don't agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services may evolve over time, we may change, enhance, or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of any major changes in, or any discontinuance of, the Services.

## 16. Governing Law and Forum Choice

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 "Dispute Resolution," the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) will be the courts located in Victoria, Australia, and you and Lightfast each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

## 17. Dispute Resolution

### (a) Good Faith Negotiation
Before initiating any formal dispute resolution process, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") through good faith negotiation. The party raising the dispute must provide written notice to the other party describing the nature and basis of the dispute and the relief sought. The parties will then attempt to resolve the dispute through direct discussion within thirty (30) days of the notice.

### (b) Mediation
If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute through negotiation, they agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute through mediation administered by the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (ACICA) or another mutually agreed mediator before pursuing any other remedy. The mediation shall take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, unless the parties mutually agree to another location.

### (c) Arbitration
If mediation is unsuccessful, any Dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by ACICA in accordance with its Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if they cannot agree, appointed according to ACICA rules. The arbitration shall take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and shall be conducted in English. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on both parties.

### (d) Exceptions
Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek urgent injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, including but not limited to the protection of intellectual property rights, pending the outcome of arbitration.

### (e) Class Action Waiver
YOU AND LIGHTFAST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

### (f) Costs
Each party shall bear its own costs in any negotiation or mediation. The costs of arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees, shall be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitrator determines otherwise based on the merits of the case.

### (g) Governing Law for Arbitration
The arbitration agreement and any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section 17 shall be governed by the Australian International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) and the ACICA Arbitration Rules.

### (h) Severability
If any provision of this Dispute Resolution section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

## 18. General Terms

### (a) Reservation of Rights
Lightfast and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services and Lightfast API, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services and Lightfast API are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.

### (b) Entire Agreement
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Lightfast and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Lightfast and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except where provided by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Lightfast's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory right, without such consent, will be null. Lightfast may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

### (c) Notices
Any notices or other communications provided by Lightfast under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

### (d) Waiver of Rights
Lightfast's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Lightfast. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
