# Enhanced Edge Type Safety Implementation Plan

## Overview

This project aims to improve the type safety of the edge connection system in React TD, focusing on compile-time validation of handle IDs and establishing a single source of truth for connection validation.

## Implementation Phases

1. **Enhanced Handle Types**: Create branded types for TextureHandleId and OutputHandleId with compile-time validation
2. **Connection Types**: Implement a stricter Connection interface with guaranteed valid handle IDs
3. **Edge Schema**: Update the edge database schema to use the new handle types
4. **UI Components**: Update UI components to work with strictly typed handles
5. **Hook Logic**: Refactor hook implementations to use the new type system
6. **WebGL Registry**: Update the WebGL registry to leverage the type system
7. **Validation Middleware**: Implement connection validation middleware for React Flow
8. **TextureUniform Simplification**: Remove redundant fields from TextureUniform
9. **Unified Texture Update**: Implement a unified, configuration-driven texture update system

## Getting Started

To understand the implementation plan:

1. Start with the `00-analysis/problem-statement.md` to understand the issues being addressed
2. Review the architecture in `01-design/architecture-overview.md`
3. Explore each phase in the `02-implementation/` directory
4. See the timeline in `IMPLEMENTATION-TIMELINE.md` for the sequence of implementation

## Adding New Features

When adding new features to this implementation plan:

1. Create a proposal in `05-extensions/proposals/proposal-XXX-[feature-name].md`
2. Update the `enhancement-tracker.md` with the new proposal
3. If approved, integrate into the appropriate implementation phase

## Development Guidelines

- Each implementation phase contains a `specification.md` describing what should be implemented
- Implementation details are in `implementation.md` files
- Follow the dependency chain detailed in the `IMPLEMENTATION-TIMELINE.md`
- Add tests according to the plans in the `03-testing/` directory
