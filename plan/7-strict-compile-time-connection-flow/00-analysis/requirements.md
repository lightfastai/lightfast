# Requirements for Strict Compile-Time Connection Flow

## Core Requirements

1. **Type Safety for Handles**

   - Implement TypeScript branded types for texture input handles
   - Implement TypeScript branded types for node output handles
   - Ensure validation at compile-time rather than runtime

2. **Connection Validation**

   - Create a single source of truth for connection validation rules
   - Provide detailed error messages for invalid connections
   - Support validation of connections between different node types

3. **Data Schema**

   - Update database schemas to support strongly typed handles
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing data
   - Ensure validation on both client and server

4. **UI Enhancements**

   - Provide visual feedback for invalid connections
   - Display detailed error messages to users
   - Prevent creation of invalid connections

5. **WebGL Integration**
   - Ensure shader uniform updates work with the new type system
   - Maintain performance with the enhanced validation
   - Validate texture connections against texture registry

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**

   - No significant performance degradation in the UI (<5%)
   - No impact on rendering performance
   - Minimal impact on connection creation time (<10ms)

2. **Backward Compatibility**

   - Must support existing projects without data migration
   - Must support existing client code via feature flags
   - Must provide clear migration path for developers

3. **Maintainability**

   - Code must be well-documented with examples
   - Tests must cover at least 90% of new code
   - Migration guides must be comprehensive

4. **Deployability**
   - Support feature flag for gradual rollout
   - Support rollback if issues are detected
   - Include database migration scripts with rollback capability

## Technical Requirements

1. **TypeScript Implementation**

   - Use TypeScript 4.7+ branded types
   - Utilize Zod for schema validation
   - Implement compile-time and runtime type guards

2. **React Flow Integration**

   - Integrate with React Flow connection system
   - Support custom connection validation
   - Provide middleware for connection events

3. **Error Handling**

   - Implement detailed error reporting
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Log validation errors for debugging

4. **Testing**

   - Unit tests for all new types and utilities
   - Integration tests for the connection flow
   - Migration tests for existing data

5. **Documentation**
   - API documentation for new types and functions
   - Migration guide for developers
   - Updated architecture documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Type Safety**

   - TypeScript errors are raised for invalid handle types at compile time
   - Invalid connections are detected before reaching the API
   - Handle types are enforced throughout the codebase

2. **User Experience**

   - Users receive clear feedback when attempting invalid connections
   - Visual indicators show potential connection targets
   - Error messages are understandable and actionable

3. **Data Integrity**

   - Existing data is properly migrated or handled
   - No data loss during migration
   - Invalid data is gracefully corrected

4. **Developer Experience**

   - Migration path is clear and well-documented
   - Feature flags enable gradual adoption
   - TypeScript errors guide developers to correct usage

5. **Performance**
   - Page load time does not increase by more than 5%
   - Connection validation completes in under 10ms
   - No noticeable lag in the UI during connections
