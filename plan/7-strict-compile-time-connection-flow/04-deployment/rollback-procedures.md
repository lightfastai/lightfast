# Rollback Procedures for Strict Compile-Time Connection Flow

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for rolling back the Strict Compile-Time Connection Flow implementation in case of critical issues. The rollback strategy is designed to minimize disruption to users and preserve data integrity.

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue Type                    | Severity    | User Impact             | Action                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Type Error in Code            | Low-Medium  | Developer-only          | Fix forward with hotfix |
| Runtime Validation Error      | Medium      | Some user errors        | Feature flag toggle     |
| Data Migration Issue          | High        | Data integrity concerns | Full rollback           |
| Performance Degradation       | Medium-High | Slow UI                 | Feature flag toggle     |
| Critical Functionality Broken | High        | Users unable to work    | Full rollback           |

## Rollback Procedures

### Procedure 1: Feature Flag Toggle (Partial Rollback)

**When to use:** For runtime validation errors, performance issues, or non-critical UI bugs.

**Rollback Steps:**

1. Access the feature flag management system
2. Locate the `strict-connection-flow` flag
3. Set the flag to `false` for the affected user segments or globally
4. Verify that the system reverts to legacy behavior
5. Monitor for any side effects
6. Notify users of the temporary rollback

**Command-line toggle:**

```bash
# Disable feature flag globally
./scripts/feature-flags.sh disable strict-connection-flow --scope=global

# Disable for specific user segment
./scripts/feature-flags.sh disable strict-connection-flow --scope=segment --segment=beta
```

**Verification:**

1. Create a new connection in the UI
2. Verify legacy validation is used
3. Check for any console errors

**Recovery Time:** < 5 minutes

### Procedure 2: Code Rollback (Full Rollback)

**When to use:** For critical bugs that cannot be addressed with feature flags.

**Rollback Steps:**

1. Identify the last stable deployment
2. Trigger the rollback deployment
3. Verify database consistency
4. Monitor system stability
5. Notify users of the rollback

**Command-line rollback:**

```bash
# Rollback to last stable version
./scripts/deploy.sh rollback --environment=production --version=v2.5.4

# Verify deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh status
```

**Verification:**

1. Run smoke tests on critical paths
2. Verify connections work properly
3. Check error logs for new issues

**Recovery Time:** 10-30 minutes

### Procedure 3: Database Rollback (Emergency Rollback)

**When to use:** For data integrity issues caused by the migration.

**Rollback Steps:**

1. Stop the application to prevent further writes
2. Run the database rollback script
3. Verify data integrity
4. Deploy code rollback
5. Start the application
6. Notify users of the emergency maintenance

**Command-line rollback:**

```bash
# Stop the application
./scripts/app.sh stop --environment=production

# Run database rollback
./scripts/migrations.sh rollback --migration=strict-connection-flow

# Verify database state
./scripts/migrations.sh verify

# Start the application
./scripts/app.sh start --environment=production
```

**Verification:**

1. Verify migration tables show rollback completed
2. Run data integrity checks
3. Verify application functionality with rolled back data

**Recovery Time:** 30-60 minutes

### External User Communication

```
[PRODUCT NAME] System Update

We've identified an issue with the recent update to the connection system.
To ensure you can continue working without interruption, we've temporarily
rolled back this feature.

No action is required on your part, and all your existing connections are safe.

We're working to address the issue and will provide updates on the timeline
for re-enabling the improved connection system.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact support.
```

## Post-Rollback Tasks

1. **Root Cause Analysis**:

   - Collect logs and error reports
   - Identify the source of the issue
   - Document findings in incident report

2. **Fix Development**:

   - Create fix branches from pre-rollback code
   - Implement and test fixes
   - Get peer review on the fix

3. **Validation**:

   - Verify fix resolves the original issue
   - Run regression tests
   - Test fix in staging environment

4. **Re-deployment Planning**:
   - Schedule new deployment with fix
   - Update rollout plan based on lessons learned
   - Brief team on changes to deployment approach

## Rollback Testing

Prior to deployment, the following rollback scenarios should be tested in the staging environment:

1. **Feature Flag Testing**:

   - Verify feature can be toggled on/off without restart
   - Ensure both code paths work correctly
   - Measure time to toggle feature for all users

2. **Code Rollback Testing**:

   - Practice deployment rollback procedure
   - Verify application stability after rollback
   - Measure time to complete rollback

3. **Database Rollback Testing**:
   - Test migration and rollback scripts
   - Verify data integrity after rollback
   - Measure time to complete database rollback

## Monitoring During Rollback

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Error Rates**:

   - API error rate
   - Client-side error rate
   - Connection validation errors

2. **Performance Metrics**:

   - API response times
   - UI render times
   - Database query times

3. **User Metrics**:
   - Active users
   - Connection creation rate
   - Support ticket volume

### Alerting Thresholds

| Metric                  | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Action                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| API Error Rate          | >1%               | >5%                | Alert on-call engineer |
| Connection Success Rate | <95%              | <90%               | Alert on-call engineer |
| API Response Time       | >500ms            | >1000ms            | Alert on-call engineer |
| Support Tickets         | >5/hour           | >10/hour           | Add support staff      |

## Recovery Plan

After successful rollback, follow these steps to recover:

1. **Stabilize**:

   - Ensure system is stable with the rollback
   - Communicate status to users
   - Resume normal operations

2. **Analyze**:

   - Complete root cause analysis
   - Update test cases to catch similar issues
   - Document lessons learned

3. **Fix**:

   - Develop and test fixes
   - Create migration recovery plan
   - Plan new deployment with fixes

4. **Retry**:
   - Schedule redeployment with fixes
   - Follow updated deployment plan
   - Increase monitoring for the second attempt
