# Rollout Plan for Strict Compile-Time Connection Flow

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for deploying the Strict Compile-Time Connection Flow enhancement to production. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to users while providing a robust rollback path if issues arise.

## Phased Deployment Strategy

Given the fundamental nature of this change to the connection system, we will use a phased deployment approach to minimize risk.

### Phase 1: Development Environment (Week 1)

- Deploy the full implementation to the development environment
- Conduct internal testing with developers and QA
- Fix issues found during internal testing
- Update documentation for developers

### Phase 2: Staging Environment (Week 2)

- Deploy to staging environment
- Conduct integration testing with real data
- Test migrations with production-like data
- Run performance tests to ensure no degradation
- Verify backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Beta Users (Week 3)

- Deploy to a subset of production users (5-10% of users)
- Enable via feature flag for opt-in beta testers
- Collect feedback and monitor error rates
- Verify that error rates remain below 0.1%
- Fix any issues found during beta testing

### Phase 4: Gradual Production Rollout (Weeks 4-6)

- 10% of users (Week 4)
- 25% of users (Week 4)
- 50% of users (Week 5)
- 75% of users (Week 5)
- 100% of users (Week 6)

### Phase 5: Feature Flag Removal (Week 8)

- Remove feature flags after 2 weeks of stable operation
- Clean up legacy code paths
- Finalize documentation

## Deployment Prerequisites

1. **Database Migration Ready**: Migration scripts tested and ready to run
2. **Rollback Scripts Ready**: Scripts for rolling back database changes if needed
3. **Feature Flags Implemented**: Ability to enable/disable features for specific users
4. **Monitoring in Place**: Error tracking, performance monitoring, and alerting configured
5. **Documentation Updated**: User and developer documentation ready

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Schedule deployment during low-traffic period
- [ ] Notify internal teams (support, customer success) of the upcoming changes
- [ ] Conduct final pre-deployment review with engineering team
- [ ] Prepare database backups
- [ ] Verify monitoring dashboards are configured

### 2. Database Migration

- [ ] Execute the database migration scripts with transactions
- [ ] Verify migration success with validation queries
- [ ] Capture migration metrics (time taken, rows affected)
- [ ] Create backup points for potential rollback

### 3. Code Deployment

- [ ] Deploy code with feature flags disabled
- [ ] Verify deployment with smoke tests
- [ ] Enable feature flags for internal users
- [ ] Verify functionality with internal users
- [ ] Begin phased rollout according to the timeline

### 4. Post-Deployment Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- [ ] Compare pre and post-deployment metrics
- [ ] Conduct user experience sampling
- [ ] Hold daily check-ins for the first week after deployment
- [ ] Document any issues and resolutions

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback

- Error rate exceeds 1% for any user segment
- Critical functionality broken for >5% of users
- Performance degradation >20% in key metrics
- Data integrity issues detected

### Rollback Steps

1. **Disable Feature Flags**: Immediately turn off feature flags to revert to old behavior
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope and nature of the issue
3. **Database Rollback**: If necessary, execute database rollback scripts
4. **Code Rollback**: If feature flags are insufficient, roll back code deployment
5. **Notify Users**: Inform affected users of the rollback and status
6. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify and document the cause of issues
7. **Fix and Reschedule**: Address issues and plan new deployment

## Communication Plan

### Internal Stakeholders

- Daily status updates during deployment week
- Immediate notification of any issues or changes to the plan
- Documentation of lessons learned post-deployment

### External Users

- Release notes detailing new features and improvements
- In-app notifications for beta users with feedback mechanism
- Support documentation for any user-facing changes
- Email communication for significant updates

## Success Metrics

| Metric               | Target            | Monitoring Method      |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Error Rate           | <0.1%             | Error tracking system  |
| Performance Impact   | <5% degradation   | APM tools              |
| User Reported Issues | <10 in first week | Support tickets        |
| Test Coverage        | >90%              | CI/CD pipeline         |
| Time to Rollback     | <30 minutes       | Incident response time |

## Post-Deployment Tasks

- Conduct retrospective meeting to document lessons learned
- Update documentation based on actual deployment experience
- Archive deployment artifacts and logs
- Create knowledge base articles for common questions
- Measure impact on development velocity for future features

## Timeline

| Week   | Activity                                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | Development environment deployment and testing |
| Week 2 | Staging environment deployment and testing     |
| Week 3 | Beta user deployment (5-10% of users)          |
| Week 4 | Production rollout to 10%, then 25% of users   |
| Week 5 | Production rollout to 50%, then 75% of users   |
| Week 6 | Production rollout to 100% of users            |
| Week 7 | Monitoring and stabilization                   |
