# Lightfast Specification

## Mission
Build a cloud-native agent execution engine that abstracts infrastructure complexity, enabling developers to focus on building AI agent applications.

## Core Goals

### Product Architecture
- **State-Machine Engine**: Orchestrate complex agent workflows with proper resource management
- **Resource Scheduling**: Intelligently manage constrained resources (Linux sandboxes, Browserbase sessions, API quotas)
- **Security Layer**: Built-in guards, validation, and runtime constraints to prevent common vulnerabilities
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Human-in-the-loop workflows, pause/resume, ambient agents, infinitely long execution
- **Developer SDK**: Simple APIs that hide complexity while maintaining flexibility

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Developers building AI agent products (v0.dev, CodeRabbit, Lovable, HumanLayer)
- **Secondary**: Teams migrating from verbose frameworks or building custom orchestration
- **Positioning**: Infrastructure layer for the agent economy

### Competitive Advantage
- **vs AI frameworks** (Langchain, CrewAI): Less verbose, production-ready defaults
- **vs Web platforms** (Inngest, Trigger.dev): AI-native with agent-specific primitives
- **Core differentiation**: "Vercel-like DX" - deploy agents in minutes, not days

### Business Model
- **Usage-Based**: Pay for compute, orchestration, and resource usage
- **Subscriptions**: Enhanced features, priority support, SLAs
- **Free Tier**: Generous limits for prototyping and small projects
- **Enterprise**: Custom deployments, dedicated infrastructure

### Long-Term Vision
Use commercial success to fund AGI research - building the "Jarvis execution brain" that can orchestrate arbitrary tasks with human-level reasoning.
