## Mission

Make organizational intent computable so teams — and their AI tools — act with shared context.

Vision: Any tool or agent can answer why, who, how, and what depends on what — with evidence — across the company’s ecosystem, in real time.

---

## Product Overview

Lightfast is a relationships‑first memory platform composed of two layers:

- Memory Graph: entities, typed relationships, and beliefs (mission, vision, principles, goals) with provenance and confidence.
- Knowledge Store: durable, chunked documents with hybrid retrieval for high recall and snappy responses.

Interfaces: MCP for AI tools, REST API for custom apps, optional web UI and chat bots for teams.

---

## Core Capabilities

- Connectors & Sync: GitHub, Slack, Linear, Notion, and others feed the Knowledge Store and Memory Graph in near real time.
- Hybrid Search: lexical + vector retrieval over chunked knowledge; graph‑aware bias for relationship questions.
- Memory Graph: ownership, dependencies, duplicates, and alignment to goals — with explainable edges and supporting text.
- Q&A: multi‑hop answers with source citations and a concise graph rationale.

---

## Guiding Principles

- Relationship first; retrieval second.
- Durable, real‑time, and explainable.
- Developer‑first, config‑driven, and interoperable.
- Privacy and tenancy by default.
- Evaluation‑backed decisions.

## North‑Star Outcomes

- Time‑to‑context: seconds to “the why” behind any artifact.
- Graph coverage: share of artifacts linked to owners, dependencies, and goals.
- Answer quality: multi‑hop questions answered with evidence.
- Onboarding compression: time saved to productive contributions.
- Agent success: task completion rate when powered by our memory.
